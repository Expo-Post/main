As a HS, I created this idea to be, lets say, a "rip off" twitter. THIS CAN AND WILL LOOK DIFFERENT, but I need help in your spare time if you'd like.

It would be lovely as I really do not know what I'm doing,
but using what I do indeed know.

I know express (js) and sqlite3 (sql). If it's better in a different way, feel free. I will adapt. This 'company' is just something I can use to dissosiate myself as a whole to possibly a group if it goes far.
